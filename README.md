We propose Video Deblurring Transformer (VDTR), a simple yet effective model that takes advantage of the long-range and relation modeling characteristics of Transformer for video deblurring. VDTR utilizes pure Transformer for both spatial and temporal modeling and obtaines highly competitive performance on the popular video deblurring benchmearks. Code will be public soon.

VDTR surpasses CNN-based state-of-the-art methods more than 1.5dB PSNR with moderate computational costs:

> Spatio-temporal learning is significant for video deblurring, which is dominated by convolution-based methods. This paper presents VDTR, an effective Transformer-based model that makes the first attempt to adapt Transformer for video deblurring. VDTR exploits the superior long-range and relation modeling capabilities of Transformer for both spatial and temporal modeling. However, it is challenging to design an appropriate Transformer-based model for video deblurring due to the high computational costs for high-resolution spatial mooodeling and the misalignment across frames for temporal modeling. To address these problems, VDTR advocates performing attention within non-overlapping windows and exploiting the hierarchical structure for long-range dependencies modeling. For frame-level spatial modeling, we propose an encoder-decoder Transformer that utilizes multi-scale features for deblurring. For multi-frame temporal modeling, we adapt Transformer to fuse multiple spatial features efficiently. Compared with CNN-based methods, the proposed method achieves highly competitive results on both synthetic and real-world video deblurring benchmarks, including DVD, GOPRO, REDS and BSD. We hope such a pure Transformer-based architecture can serve as a powerful alternative baseline for video deblurring and other video restoration tasks.

### Environment
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch >= 1.5
```bash
git clone  git clone https://github.com/ljzycmd/SimDeblur.git

# install the SimDeblur
cd SimDeblur
bash Install.sh
```

### Quick Start

1. Clone the codes of VDTR
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ljzycmd/VDTR.git
```

2. Download and unzip the datasets
* [DVD](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2017/DeepVideoDeblurring/)
* [GOPRO](https://seungjunnah.github.io/Datasets/gopro)
Then create the soft link of the datasets to the **./datasets** folder.

3. Run the training script
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=10086 train.py ./configs/vdtr/vdtr_dvd.yaml --gpus=4
```
the training logs are saved in ./workdir/*

4. Run the testing script (single GPU)
```bash
python test.py ./configs/vdtr/vdtr_dvd.yaml $Checkpoint_path
```
the testing logs and frames are saved in ./workdir/*.

### Experimental Results

VDTR achieves competitive PSNR and SSIM on both synthetic and real-world deblurring dataset.
